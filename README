First experiment: turn that red LED off!

The LED red on the CI20 is controlled by GPIO (general-purpose input/output) pins of the CPU.

Requirements:

1. mips-sde-elf GCC compiler
2. Linux mkimage utility
3. QEMU-mipsel (optional)


Building:

To build the project, simply execute "make".


Running (from u-boot console):

1. power the board
2. when you see "Hit any key to stop autoboot", press enter
3. enter "loads"
4. copy-paste contents of build/exp1.srec into the u-boot console
5. enter "go 0x8001000"


Running (from SD card):

1. insert a working Linux SD card for CI20
2. backup the boot/vmlinux.img file
3. copy build/exp1.img over boot/vmlinux.img
4. safely eject the SD card and insert it into the CI 20
5. power the board!
