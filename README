CI20-baremetal
==============

This repository contains a number of bare-metal experiments for the MIPS Creator CI20 development board:

The experiments were inspired by the "Baking Pi - Operating Systems Development" course by Alex Chadwick at University of Cambridge:

Each experiment is included as a branch in this Git repository. This is an unusual arrangement, but seems to work okay for this particular setup.


THE EXPERIMENTS
---------------

Some notable experiments are:

* exp1 - simplest possible example to access and turn of a LED
* exp2 - code to periodically turn the LED on and off
* exp3 - same as exp2, but the code is now organized in a number of functions
* exp4 - same as exp2, but the code is spread across multiple files. Uses RTC timer for the blinking time
* exp_uart - uses UART to communicate with the board. Also, introduces C...



DOWNLOADING
-----------

For those unfamiliar with Git, you can download everything by cloning the repository:


```
git clone https://vahidi@bitbucket.org/vahidi/ci20-baremetal.git

```

To access an experiment, you checkout the corresponding branch. For example, to get "exp1" you should do this:

```
git checkout exp1
```
